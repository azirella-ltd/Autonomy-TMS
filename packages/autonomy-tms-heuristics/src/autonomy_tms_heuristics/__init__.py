"""autonomy-tms-heuristics — TMS-team-owned heuristic policies (AD-12).

This package is the **single authoritative source** of TMS conservative-
default heuristic math, used by three consumer paths (PR-LOCK, 2026-05-04):

1. **Internal TRM runtime fallback** — every TMS TRM in
   ``backend/app/services/powell/`` calls
   :func:`compute_tms_decision` (re-exported below) when its trained
   BC checkpoint is unavailable.
2. **Internal training corpus generation** — TMS pretraining scripts
   (``backend/scripts/pretraining/generate_tms_corpus.py``,
   ``trm_curriculum.py``) use :func:`compute_tms_decision` as the BC
   teacher policy. Same function as the runtime fallback; training
   labels and runtime fallback are guaranteed to agree.
3. **Cross-plane HEURISTIC-tier dispatch** by ``azirella-router`` —
   :data:`HEURISTIC_HANDLERS` is the entry-point bundle. Each handler
   builds the corresponding state dataclass from a cross-plane skill
   input, dispatches via :func:`compute_tms_decision`, and maps the
   result back to the cross-plane response shape.

This package depends only on:
- ``azirella-data-model`` (for ``ConformalBand``, geofence haversine math)
- ``azirella-heuristics-common`` (for the four-place warning regime
  + exceptions)

It does NOT depend on the TMS backend app — the TMS backend pip-installs
it like SCP/DP backends do, so the same import path
``autonomy_tms_heuristics.library.compute_tms_decision`` works in
every consumer environment.
