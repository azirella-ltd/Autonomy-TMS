### SAP CAL Appliance Setup

The FAA is provisioned via SAP Cloud Appliance Library (CAL) at [cal.sap.com](https://cal.sap.com). Our appliance is named **"Autonomy"**.

**Appliance Template**: SAP S/4HANA 2025, Fully-Activated Appliance (SP00, Update 25)

#### Virtual Machines

| VM | Size | Purpose |
|----|------|---------|
| SAP S/4HANA 2025 & SAP HANA DB 2.0 | r6i.8xlarge (32 cores, 256GB) | ABAP + HANA database |
| SAP NetWeaver 7.50 SP32 AS JAVA | r6i.xlarge (4 cores, 32GB) | Java stack, Adobe Document Services |
| Windows Remote Desktop | m6i.xlarge (4 cores, 16GB) | SAP GUI access, admin tasks |

**Running cost**: ~$3.12/hr (~$75/day) when all 3 VMs are active. Suspend when not in use.

#### CAL Configuration Checklist

After creating the appliance, configure these settings before first use:

| Setting | Location | Required Value | Why |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----|
| **Public Static IP** | Info tab | Enabled (checkbox) | Prevents external IPs from changing on every restart |
| **Termination Protection** | Info tab | Enabled (checkbox) | Prevents accidental deletion |
| **Schedule** | Schedule tab | "Manually activate and suspend" | Prevents unexpected suspension; control costs manually |
| **IP Range (Access Points)** | Virtual Machines tab | Your public IP with `/32` mask | Restricts access to your machine only |
| **Backups** | Backups tab | Create initial backup | Protects against configuration loss |

#### Access Points (Ports)

All ports are on the **SAP S/4HANA 2025 & SAP HANA DB 2.0** VM unless noted:

| Port | Service | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 3389 | RDP | Windows Remote Desktop VM access |
| 3200 | SAP GUI | ABAP client access (SAPGUI protocol) |
| 3300 | RFC | Remote Function Call (used by Autonomy connection) |
| 8443 | SAP Cloud Connector | Cloud integration |
| 44300 | Fiori HTTP | Fiori Launchpad (HTTP) |
| 44301 | Fiori HTTPS | Fiori Launchpad (HTTPS) |
| 50000 | HTTP Admin | NetWeaver HTTP administration |
| 30213 | HANA Studio | HANA database administration |
| 30215 | HANA indexserver | HANA SQL access |
| 22 | SSH | Shell access to S/4HANA VM |

**Security**: Set the IP Range for all access points to `<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>/32`. Determine your public IP with `curl ifconfig.me`. If your ISP uses dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6), you may need to add both your IPv4 (`x.x.x.x/32`) and IPv6 (`xxxx:xxxx:.../128`) addresses — AWS security groups must allow whichever protocol your traffic arrives on. If connectivity fails after restricting, temporarily use "Clear Restrictions" to reset to `0.0.0.0/0` and troubleshoot.

#### Connection Details

External IPs are assigned by AWS. With **Public Static IP** enabled, these persist across restarts:

| VM | Internal IP | External IP | Primary Access |
|----|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| SAP S/4HANA 2025 & SAP HANA DB 2.0 | 10.0.8.104 | *(from CAL Info tab)* | RFC 3300, Fiori 44301, SAP GUI 3200 |
| SAP NetWeaver 7.50 AS JAVA | 10.0.3.227 | *(from CAL Info tab)* | HTTP 50000 |
| Windows Remote Desktop | 10.0.15.197 | *(from CAL Info tab)* | RDP 3389 |

**Note**: Internal IPs are stable within the VPC. From the Windows RDP VM, connect to SAP GUI using the internal IP (10.0.8.104) rather than the external IP.

#### Licensing

| Period | Status | Action Required |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Days 0–30 | Free trial | Hosting fees only |
| Days 30–90 | Temporary license | Unlock appliance template in SAP CAL |
| Day 90+ | License key required | Install keys via `/nSLICENSE` (ABAP) and NWA (Java) |

License expiry is shown on the License Status tab in CAL. Plan demo timelines accordingly.

#### Suspend / Activate

- **Suspend**: Appliances list → three-dot menu (**...**) → Suspend. Stops all VMs, preserves data. Storage fees only (~$5-10/day).
- **Activate**: Appliances list → click "Activate". Takes 10-15 minutes for all VMs to start and SAP services to initialize.
- **Schedule**: Use "Suspend on an exact date" as a safety net to avoid runaway costs if you forget to suspend manually. Set to a date before license expiry.

#### RDP Access to Windows VM

RDP is required for SAP GUI access (pre-connection steps, demo execution, user management).

**Prerequisites**:
- RDP client installed (Linux: Remmina or xfreerdp; macOS: Microsoft Remote Desktop; Windows: built-in)
- Access Points IP Range allows your public IP

**Connection**:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Protocol | RDP |
| Server | *(Windows VM external IP from CAL Info tab)* |
| Port | 3389 |
| Username | `Administrator` |
| Password | *(from CAL "Connect" button or Getting Started Guide — uses the Master Password set during appliance creation)* |

**Linux (Remmina)**:
1. Open Remmina → click "+" or use quick connect
2. Protocol: RDP, Server: `<WINDOWS_EXTERNAL_IP>`, Username: `Administrator`
3. If Remmina fails with "Could not resolve hostname to IPv6", install and use xfreerdp instead:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y freerdp3-x11
   xfreerdp3 /v:<WINDOWS_EXTERNAL_IP> /u:Administrator /port:3389
   ```

**Troubleshooting RDP**:
- **"Could not resolve hostname to IPv6"**: Your network may route via IPv6 but the SAP security group only allows IPv4. Add your IPv6 address to the Access Points IP Range, or use xfreerdp with explicit IPv4.
- **Connection timeout**: Check that the appliance is Active in CAL (not Suspended). Verify Access Points IP Range includes your current public IP.
- **After reactivation**: If Public Static IP was not enabled, external IPs will have changed. Check the Info tab for new IPs.

**Once connected**: SAP GUI is pre-installed on the Windows desktop with a connection pre-configured to the S/4HANA system (internal IP 10.0.8.104, instance 00).

### Pre-Connection Checklist

Before connecting Autonomy to the FAA, the following steps must be completed via SAP GUI.
For detailed user permissions by connection type (RFC, OData, HANA DB, CSV), see [SAP Integration Guide — User Permissions](../external/SAP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md#sap-user-permissions-by-connection-type).

1. **Unlock RFC user** — BPINST is LOCKED by default in the 2025 template. Login as `DDIC` (client 000) or `SAP*` (client 000, Master Password) via SAP GUI. Use tCode `SU01` to unlock the user, or create a dedicated `ZRFC_AUTONOMY` user in client 100 (recommended).
2. **Open MM inventory period** — tCode `MMPV` in client 100 (required for inventory data extraction).
3. **Hosts file mapping** — Add `<ABAP_PUBLIC_IP> vhcals4hcs.dummy.nodomain` to local hosts file for Fiori Launchpad access.
4. **Verify ports** — Ensure AWS Security Group allows inbound on ports 3200 (SAP GUI), 3300 (RFC), 44301 (Fiori HTTPS), 30213/30215 (HANA Studio).

### Autonomy Connection Settings

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| System Type | S/4HANA |
| Connection Method | RFC |
| Application Server | `<ABAP_PUBLIC_IP>` |
| System Number | 00 |
| Client | 100 |
| User | ZRFC_AUTONOMY (or unlocked BPINST) |
| Company Code Filter | 1710 |

## 2. FAA Logistics Demo Scenarios

The FAA includes 9 pre-configured logistics demo scenarios with pre-defined users and transactional data. Each scenario below is mapped to the corresponding Autonomy capability.

### 2.1 Sell from Stock with Outbound Delivery Processing

**SAP Process**: Order-to-Cash (OTC) — Sales order creation → availability check → delivery → goods issue → billing.

**Key SAP tCodes**: VA01 (Sales Order), VL01N (Delivery), VL02N (Goods Issue), VF01 (Billing)

**SAP Tables Extracted**:
- `VBAK` / `VBAP` → `outbound_order` / `outbound_order_line`
- `LIKP` / `LIPS` → `shipment` / `shipment_line`
- `MARD` → `inv_level`

**Autonomy Mapping**:
| SAP Step | Autonomy Feature |
|----------|-----------------|
| Manual ATP check (VA01) | **ATP Executor TRM** — AATP with priority consumption, <10ms |
| Delivery creation (VL01N) | **TO Execution TRM** — Automated release, consolidation, expedite |
| Goods issue (VL02N) | **Inventory Management** — Real-time inv_level updates |
| Order tracking | **Order Tracking TRM** — Exception detection and recommended actions |

**Demo Value**: SAP requires manual availability checks per order. Autonomy's AATP handles 100+ decisions/second with priority-based allocation tiers.

---

### 2.2 Warehouse Inbound Processing from Supplier

**SAP Process**: Procure-to-Pay (P2P) — Purchase order → goods receipt → warehouse putaway → invoice verification.

**Key SAP tCodes**: ME21N (PO Creation), MIGO (Goods Receipt), MIRO (Invoice Verification)

**SAP Tables Extracted**:
- `EKKO` / `EKPO` → `inbound_order` / `inbound_order_line`
- `EINA` / `EINE` → `vendor_product` / `vendor_lead_time`
- `EORD` → `sourcing_rules`
- `MARD` → `inv_level`

**Autonomy Mapping**:
| SAP Step | Autonomy Feature |
|----------|-----------------|
| PO creation (ME21N) | **PO Creation TRM** — Optimized timing and quantity |
| Vendor selection | **Sourcing rules** with multi-sourcing priorities |
| Goods receipt (MIGO) | **Inventory Management** — Automatic inv_level update |
| Lead time tracking | **Distribution fitting** — Log-logistic lead time modeling |

**Demo Value**: SAP uses fixed planned delivery times. Autonomy fits actual lead time distributions (log-logistic, Weibull) and uses Monte Carlo DDLT for safety stock calculation.

---

### 2.3 Plan to Produce using Advanced Planning for Capacity Utilization

**SAP Process**: Plan-to-Produce — Demand planning → MPS → capacity leveling → production order → confirmation.

**Key SAP tCodes**: MD61 (Planned Independent Requirements), MD43 (MRP Individual), CM01 (Capacity Leveling), CO01 (Production Order)

**SAP Tables Extracted**:
- `AFKO` / `AFPO` → `production_order` / `production_order_line`
- `STPO` → `product_bom`
- `MARC` → `product` (plant-level data)
- `CRHD` → `resource` (work centers)

**Autonomy Mapping**:
| SAP Step | Autonomy Feature |
|----------|-----------------|
| MPS (MD43) | **Master Production Scheduling** — Strategic production planning with rough-cut capacity |
| Capacity leveling (CM01) | **Capacity Planning** — Resource utilization, bottleneck identification |
| Production order (CO01) | **MO Execution TRM** — Release, sequence, split, expedite, defer |
| Confirmation (CO15) | **CDC Relearning** — Actual outcomes feed back into TRM training |

**Demo Value**: SAP capacity planning is manual leveling. Autonomy uses GraphSAGE for bottleneck detection and MO Execution TRM for automated production scheduling with stochastic yield modeling.

---

### 2.4 Predictive Material & Resource Planning (pMRP)

**SAP Process**: ML-enhanced MRP — Predictive demand → net requirements → planned orders → capacity check.

**Key SAP tCodes**: MD01 (MRP Run), MD04 (Stock/Requirements List), MDBT (MRP Background)

**SAP Tables Extracted**:
- `MARA` / `MARC` → `product`
- `MARD` → `inv_level`
- `STPO` → `product_bom`
- `EKET` → `supply_plan` (PO schedule lines)
- `EORD` → `sourcing_rules`

**Autonomy Mapping**:
| SAP Step | Autonomy Feature |
|----------|-----------------|
| MRP run (MD01) | **Net Requirements Calculator** — Time-phased netting, multi-level BOM explosion |
| Demand forecast | **Demand Processor** — Stochastic forecasting with P10/P50/P90 percentiles |
| Safety stock | **Inventory Target Calculator** — 8 policy types (abs_level, doc_dem, doc_fcst, sl, sl_fitted, conformal, sl_conformal_fitted, econ_optimal) |
| Planned orders | **Supply Plan Generation** — PO/TO/MO requests with sourcing priorities |

**Demo Value**: SAP pMRP produces single-point estimates. Autonomy generates probabilistic supply plans with full uncertainty quantification — "85% chance service level > 95%" vs SAP's deterministic output.

---

### 2.5 Demand-Driven MRP (DDMRP)

**SAP Process**: Buffer-based replenishment — Define buffers → calculate net flow → generate demand-driven planned orders.

**Key SAP tCodes**: MD01 with DDMRP profile, MD04 (Stock/Requirements List)

**SAP Tables Extracted**:
- `MARC` → `product` (MRP profiles, reorder points)
- `MARD` → `inv_level`
- Buffer zone configuration (custom tables)

**Autonomy Mapping**:
| SAP Step | Autonomy Feature |
|----------|-----------------|
| Buffer sizing | **Inventory Buffer TRM** — AI-optimized buffer adjustment |
| Net flow calculation | **`econ_optimal` policy** — Marginal economic return via Monte Carlo DDLT |
| Buffer status monitoring | **Conformal prediction** — Distribution-free guarantee on buffer adequacy |
| Replanning | **CDC Relearning Loop** — Autonomous feedback for continuous improvement |

**Demo Value**: SAP DDMRP uses static buffer zones with manual tuning. Autonomy's Inventory Buffer TRM learns optimal buffer levels from outcomes and automatically reoptimizes via the CDC relearning loop. The `econ_optimal` policy stocks where `stockout_cost × P(demand>k) > holding_cost` — a mathematically rigorous alternative to DDMRP's color-coded zones.

---

### 2.6 Order Management using Advanced Variant Configuration

**SAP Process**: Configure-to-Order — Variant configuration → BOM explosion → routing determination → order creation.

**Key SAP tCodes**: VA01 with variant config, CU41 (Dependency Editor), CS01 (BOM)

**SAP Tables Extracted**:
- `STPO` → `product_bom` (multi-level with variants)
- `MARA` → `product` (configurable materials)
- `VBAK` / `VBAP` → `outbound_order` / `outbound_order_line`

**Autonomy Mapping**:
| SAP Step | Autonomy Feature |
|----------|-----------------|
| BOM explosion | **Multi-level BOM explosion** in Net Requirements Calculator |
| Variant resolution | **product_bom** with scrap rates and transformation ratios |
| Order processing | **ATP Executor TRM** + **MO Execution TRM** |

**Demo Value**: Autonomy handles BOM explosion with stochastic yields and scrap rates — uncertainty propagation through multi-level BOMs that SAP's deterministic explosion cannot provide.

---

### 2.7 Advanced Available-to-Promise / Back Order Processing (aATP, BOP)

**SAP Process**: Advanced ATP — Multi-level availability check → allocation → backorder processing → confirmation.

**Key SAP tCodes**: VA01 (with aATP), /SAPAPO/AC04 (Allocation), /SAPAPO/BOP (Backorder Processing)

**SAP Tables Extracted**:
- `VBAK` / `VBAP` → `outbound_order` / `outbound_order_line`
- `EKET` → `supply_plan` (ATP quantities)
- `MARD` → `inv_level`

**Autonomy Mapping**:
| SAP Step | Autonomy Feature |
|----------|-----------------|
| ATP check | **ATP Executor TRM** — AATP with priority consumption sequence |
| Allocation | **Allocation Service** — Priority × Product × Location from tGNN |
| Backorder processing | **Order Tracking TRM** — Exception detection, recommended actions |
| Confirmation | **Conformal Decision Theory** — P(loss > threshold) on every decision |

**Demo Value**: SAP aATP allocates by customer priority but lacks AI-driven optimization. Autonomy's AATP uses a learned priority consumption sequence: own tier first, then bottom-up from lowest priority, stopping at own tier. The tGNN generates network-wide allocations daily, and CDT provides distribution-free risk bounds on every ATP decision.

**AATP Consumption Logic**:
```
Order at priority P=2: consume [2, 5, 4, 3] (skips priority 1)
Order at priority P=1: consume [1, 5, 4, 3, 2] (all tiers)
```

---

### 2.8 Advanced Intercompany Sales

**SAP Process**: Multi-entity transaction — Intercompany sales order → cross-company delivery → intercompany billing.

**Key SAP tCodes**: VA01 (Intercompany SO), VL01N (Cross-company delivery), VF01 (IC billing)

**SAP Tables Extracted**:
- `VBAK` / `VBAP` → `outbound_order` / `outbound_order_line`
- `T001W` → `site` (multiple plants/companies)
- `LTAK` / `LTAP` → `transfer_order` / `transfer_order_line`

**Autonomy Mapping**:
| SAP Step | Autonomy Feature |
|----------|-----------------|
| Cross-company coordination | **Agentic Authorization Protocol (AAP)** — Layer 3 cross-site authorization |
| Transfer decisions | **Inventory Rebalancing TRM** — Cross-location transfer optimization |
| Multi-site visibility | **Execution tGNN** — Network-wide priority allocations |

**Demo Value**: SAP intercompany sales is a manual, document-driven process. Autonomy's AAP enables autonomous cross-site decisions at machine speed — agents evaluate trade-offs via the Balanced Scorecard and request authorization for actions outside their authority domain. The tGNN provides network-wide visibility that SAP's siloed plant-level view cannot offer.

---

### 2.9 Asset Management (Calibration Processing)

**SAP Process**: Plant Maintenance — Equipment calibration → maintenance order → execution → confirmation.

**Key SAP tCodes**: IW31 (Create PM Order), IW32 (Change PM Order), IE02 (Equipment Master)

**SAP Tables Extracted**:
- `AUFK` (PM module) → `maintenance_order`
- `IHPA` → maintenance partners
- `MHIS` → maintenance history

**Autonomy Mapping**:
| SAP Step | Autonomy Feature |
|----------|-----------------|
| Maintenance scheduling | **Maintenance Scheduling TRM** — Schedule, defer, expedite, outsource |
| Equipment monitoring | **Condition Monitor Service** — Real-time DB condition checks |
| Work order management | **MO Execution TRM** — Release and sequencing |

**Demo Value**: SAP uses time-based preventive maintenance. Autonomy's Maintenance Scheduling TRM uses condition-based AI scheduling that learns optimal maintenance windows from historical outcomes, reducing downtime while avoiding unnecessary preventive actions.

---

## 3. Autonomy Differentiators Not in FAA Demos

These capabilities have no corresponding FAA demo scenario, making them pure Autonomy differentiators:

| Capability | Autonomy Feature | Value |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Quality Management** | Quality Disposition TRM | AI-driven hold/release/rework/scrap decisions with CDT risk bounds |
| **Subcontracting** | Subcontracting TRM | Make-vs-buy routing optimization with learned cost models |
| **Transportation Optimization** | TO Execution TRM | Consolidation, mode selection, cross-border optimization |
| **Forecast Adjustment** | Forecast Adjustment TRM | Signal-driven adjustments from email, voice, market intelligence |
| **Network Risk Visibility** | S&OP GraphSAGE | Concentration risk, bottleneck detection, resilience scoring |
| **Override Learning** | Bayesian Beta Posteriors | Track human decision quality, feed back into AI training |
| **Probabilistic Planning** | Stochastic Framework | 21 distribution types, Monte Carlo with variance reduction |
| **Decision Intelligence** | Powell SDAM Framework | Full decision lifecycle: model → orchestrate → monitor → govern |

---

## 4. Recommended Demo Sequence

### Demo A: "SAP pMRP vs Autonomy Stochastic Planning"

**Objective**: Show probabilistic supply planning superiority over SAP's deterministic MRP.

**Steps**:
1. Run SAP's pMRP scenario (§2.4) in client 100 — execute `MD01` for plant 1710
2. Extract via Autonomy SAP Data Management: materials (MARA/MARC), BOMs (STPO), inventory (MARD), open POs (EKKO/EKPO), sales orders (VBAK/VBAP), source lists (EORD)
3. Run Autonomy supply plan with stochastic lead times + 8 policy types
4. Compare side-by-side: SAP deterministic safety stock vs Autonomy probabilistic P10/P50/P90

**Key Talking Point**: "SAP says you need 150 units of safety stock. Autonomy says there's an 85% chance your service level exceeds 95% with 120 units — saving $X in holding cost."

---

### Demo B: "SAP DDMRP vs Autonomy Inventory Buffer TRM"

**Objective**: Show AI-optimized buffers that learn from outcomes vs static buffer zones.

**Steps**:
1. Run SAP's DDMRP scenario (§2.5) — configure buffer zones in client 100
2. Extract buffer parameters and inventory data into Autonomy
3. Show Autonomy's `econ_optimal` policy — marginal economic return optimization
4. Show CDC relearning loop: buffer decisions → outcomes → automatic reoptimization

**Key Talking Point**: "SAP DDMRP requires manual buffer tuning every planning cycle. Autonomy's Inventory Buffer TRM learns from every replenishment outcome and reoptimizes automatically."

---

### Demo C: "SAP aATP vs Autonomy AATP"

**Objective**: Show AI-driven ATP at 100x the speed with priority-based allocation.

**Steps**:
1. Run SAP's aATP scenario (§2.7) — process several sales orders with ATP checks
2. Extract order and inventory data into Autonomy
3. Show Autonomy AATP: priority consumption sequence + TRM <10ms decisions
4. Show tGNN-generated allocations (Priority × Product × Location)

**Key Talking Point**: "SAP processes ATP checks one at a time with manual allocation. Autonomy handles 100+ ATP decisions per second with learned priority allocation, and every decision carries a distribution-free risk bound."

---

### Demo D: "SAP Sell from Stock → AI-Automated End-to-End Execution"

**Objective**: Show full autonomous order execution from sales order to delivery.

**Steps**:
1. Run SAP scenario §2.1 end-to-end (order → delivery → goods issue)
2. Extract the complete transaction chain into Autonomy
3. Show Autonomy's TRM Hive handling the full flow: ATP TRM → MO Execution TRM → TO Execution TRM
4. Show the Agentic Authorization Protocol for any cross-site decisions
5. Show override capture and Bayesian posterior tracking

**Key Talking Point**: "What took 4 SAP users and 45 minutes, Autonomy's AI agents handle in under a second — with full explainability and human override tracking."

---

### Demo E: "Network Visibility SAP Can't Provide"

**Objective**: Show AI-driven supply chain risk analysis with no SAP equivalent.

**Steps**:
1. Extract full supply chain topology from SAP: plants (T001W), vendors (LFA1), customers (KNA1), BOMs (STPO), source lists (EORD)
2. Build GraphSAGE network model from real SAP data
3. Show: concentration risk scores, single-source vulnerability, bottleneck detection, resilience scoring
4. Show Site tGNN (Layer 1.5): cross-TRM trade-off detection within each site

**Key Talking Point**: "SAP gives you plant-level visibility. Autonomy gives you network-wide intelligence — which supplier failure would cascade to which customers, and what the AI recommends to mitigate it."

### Extended SC Planning Data (MZ Bikes)

The MZ Motorcycle Zone product line provides richer supply chain data for planning demos — BOMs, multiple customers, purchase orders, production history. Use this data for Autonomy-specific demos (stochastic planning, AI agents, scenario events).

### Plants/Sites

## 9. SAP Change Simulator — Extract Once, Simulate Ongoing

**Purpose**: Extract all data from SAP in a single session (~1-2 hours, ~$3-6), then shut down the FAA to save ~$75/day. A lightweight simulator generates realistic change events that trigger Autonomy's existing CDC pipeline — no SAP needed.

### 8.1 Phase 1: Full SAP Extraction (SAP Running)

1. Connect Autonomy → SAP via RFC (see §1)
2. Extract all 3 phases from §5 (master data → transactions → history)
3. Save CSVs to `imports/SAP/{tenant_name}/` as backup (see §6)
4. Load everything into Autonomy's DB via SAP Data Management ingestion
5. **Stop SAP instances** via SAP CAL console

### 8.2 Phase 2: SAP Change Simulator (SAP Offline)

Three layers generate realistic delta events from the extracted baseline:

**Layer 1 — Demand Generator** (simulates customer order flow)
- Uses extracted VBAP demand history to learn demand patterns (seasonality, intermittency, distribution shape)
- Generates new `outbound_order` / `outbound_order_line` records at realistic rates
- Applies stochastic perturbation (the 21 distribution types already supported)
- Optionally injects demand signals (spikes, shifts, bursts — Powell's "styles of uncertainty")

**Layer 2 — Supply Event Generator** (simulates supplier/production activity)
- New PO receipts with stochastic lead times (fitted from EKBE history)
- Production completions with stochastic yields (fitted from AFRU history)
- Inventory movements (goods issues, adjustments, transfers)
- Supplier disruptions (delayed shipments, partial deliveries, quality holds)

**Layer 3 — CDC Event Emitter** (triggers Autonomy's existing pipeline)
- Each generated event writes to the AWS SC tables (forecast, inv_level, inbound_order, etc.)
- Fires the same CDC signals that a real SAP integration would:
  - `CDCMonitor` detects metric deviations → triggers in `powell_cdc_trigger_log`
  - `OutcomeCollector` computes actual outcomes for TRM decisions
  - `CDTCalibrationService` recalibrates from decision-outcome pairs
  - `ConditionMonitorService` checks 6 real-time conditions

### 8.4 Disruption Scenarios

Predefined profiles for targeted testing:

| Scenario | Description | TRMs Tested |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Steady State** | Normal demand/supply variation (baseline) | All |
| **Demand Spike** | 2-3x demand surge on select SKUs | ATP, Inventory Buffer |
| **Supplier Disruption** | Lead time doubles for a key vendor | PO Creation, Rebalancing |
| **Quality Event** | Yield drops 20% at a plant | Quality Disposition, MO Execution |
| **Bullwhip Amplification** | Demand signal amplifies through tiers | All (classic Beer Game effect) |

### 8.5 Clock Speed

| Mode | Ratio | 1 Simulated Day = | Use Case |
|------|-------|--------------------|----------|
| `1x` | Real-time | 1 real day | Long-running demos |
| `10x` | Accelerated | 2.4 hours | Training sessions |
| `100x` | Fast-forward | ~15 minutes | Quick validation |
| `1000x` | Turbo | ~1.5 minutes | AI training data generation |

### 8.6 Capability Comparison

| Capability | With SAP Running | With Simulator |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Master data extraction | Yes | No (already extracted) |
| Ongoing demand flow | Yes (real orders) | Yes (simulated from fitted distributions) |
| TRM decision-making | Yes | Yes (identical CDC triggers) |
| CDC relearning loop | Yes | Yes (same pipeline) |
| Disruption scenarios | Wait for real events | On-demand, repeatable |
| AI training data | Slow (real-time only) | Fast (1000x speed) |
| Cost | ~$3.12/hr | $0 |

### 8.7 Implementation

- **Service**: `backend/app/services/sap_change_simulator.py`
- **API**: `backend/app/api/endpoints/sap_change_simulator.py`
- **Schedule**: Configurable via API — on-demand or periodic tick

The simulator writes to the same DB tables and triggers the same events as a real SAP CDC feed. Autonomy's TRM Hive, GNN, and relearning pipeline cannot distinguish simulated events from real ones.

## 10. "Azirella" Demo Scripts

Pre-written prompts for the Azirella bar during live demos. Each prompt is tagged with its behavior:

- **STRAIGHT-THROUGH** — All required fields present; routes immediately to the target Powell layer with no clarification.
- **CLARIFICATION** — Missing one or more required fields; the clarification panel appears with follow-up questions the presenter answers live.

Use the **SAP official demo values** (TG11, FG126, customer 17100001) for SAP audiences, and **MZ bikes** (C900, M500, Bigmart) for supply chain planning audiences.

### 10.1 Drop-in Order (Kinaxis Standard Demo)

The classic Kinaxis demo scenario: a major customer places an unexpected large order, and you watch the ripple through the supply chain in real time. This is the single most important demo script.

**Setup**: Ensure the SAP IDES 1710 config is provisioned and the Decision Stream is open.

#### Script 1a — Drop-in Order (Straight-Through)

> **Prompt**: Bigmart just called — they need 500 C900 bikes delivered to Detroit in 2 weeks. This is a new fleet deal we can't lose. Increase production and prioritize ATP allocation for this order across all MZ City bike components at Plant 1710 for the next 4 weeks.

- **Behavior**: STRAIGHT-THROUGH
- **Reason**: "new fleet deal we can't lose" + "Bigmart just called"
- **Direction**: increase
- **Metric**: capacity + service_level
- **Magnitude**: implied (500 units = specific qty, system derives %)
- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Geography**: Plant 1710
- **Products**: C900 + all MZ City bike components
- **Target Layer**: Layer 1.5 (Site tGNN — single-site coordination)
- **TRMs triggered**: ATP Executor, MO Execution, PO Creation, Inventory Buffer

**What to show**: Decision Stream lights up within seconds — ATP allocation decisions, MO release recommendations for C900 assembly, PO creation for Frame-900 and Wheels-900 components, inventory buffer adjustments. Click Inspect on each to show the reasoning chain.

#### Script 1b — Drop-in Order (Clarification)

> **Prompt**: Bigmart needs 500 bikes in 2 weeks — rush order.

- **Behavior**: CLARIFICATION
- **Missing fields**: Product (which bikes?), Geography (which plant?), Reason (why prioritize?)

  - "Why should we prioritize this? [Text input]"
- **Presenter answers**: C900, Plant 1710, "New fleet deal, strategic account"
- **Then routes**: Same as 1a

**What to show**: The clarification flow itself — the system doesn't just guess, it asks the right questions. Point out that the reason field is always required because every directive is tracked for effectiveness.

### 10.7 Demo Sequence — Recommended Order

For a 30-minute live demo, run these in order:

| # | Script | Time | Purpose |
|---|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | **1a** (Drop-in order, straight-through) | 5 min | Hero moment — show the full agentic response |
| 2 | **Question**: "Show me the supply chain network" | 2 min | Context — show the MZ Bikes topology |
| 3 | **3a** (Supplier delay, straight-through) | 5 min | Supply disruption — show cascading agent response |
| 4 | **4b** (Yield problem, clarification) | 4 min | Show the clarification flow — system asks, human answers |
| 5 | **Question**: "What's our inventory on C900?" | 1 min | Quick query routing |
| 6 | **2a** (Demand spike, straight-through) | 4 min | Demand disruption — forecast + buffer adjustment |
| 7 | **5a** (CFO cost reduction, straight-through) | 5 min | Strategic layer — show S&OP GraphSAGE response |
| 8 | **1b** (Drop-in order, clarification) | 4 min | Contrast with 1a — show incomplete vs complete |

**Key narrative arc**: Start with the "wow" moment (drop-in order handled in seconds), establish context (network view), then layer on disruptions to show resilience. End with strategic to show the full pyramid from execution to S&OP.
