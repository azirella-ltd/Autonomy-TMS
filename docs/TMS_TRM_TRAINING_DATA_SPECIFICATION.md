# TMS TRM Training Data Specification

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-04-18
**Status**: Specification — paired with `SCP/TRM_TRAINING_DATA_SPECIFICATION.md`

---

## Overview

Each TMS TRM (Tactical Response Model) is pre-trained on synthetic
transportation states labeled by deterministic heuristic teachers. The
neural model learns the *family* of reasonable decisions; at inference
time it selects from the learned policy and falls back to the
deterministic engine when confidence is below threshold. This mirrors
the SCP TRM framework — the scaffolding is shared (Core's TRMTrainer,
behavioral cloning loss, CrossEntropy + value head, parquet corpus
format) — but the state/action/reward semantics are transportation
specific.

**Domain difference vs SCP:** SCP TRMs reason about internal inventory,
lot sizing, safety stock, MRP netting. TMS TRMs reason about *external
carrier networks*: waterfall tendering, carrier acceptance probability,
dock utilization, intermodal mode shift, equipment repositioning. Where
SCP state features come from MRP tables, TMS state features come from
lane/load/shipment/carrier/dock records plus live signals (ETA feeds,
market rates, spot premiums).

## Corpus Pipeline

```
Network Generator → Transport State Sampler → Single-Teacher Labeler → Parquet Corpus
       ↓                      ↓                          ↓                        ↓
  Lane topology       Load archetypes             1 deterministic            (state, action,
  Carrier pool        Capacity scenarios          teacher per TRM            reward) tuples
  Dock network        Exception scenarios         (no multi-teacher          × 50K per TRM
  Equipment fleet     Seasonal patterns            consensus — unlike SCP)
```

**Key difference from SCP:** TMS uses a **single deterministic teacher
per state** (one call into `compute_tms_decision()` in
`tms_heuristic_library/dispatch.py`), producing one label per state.
SCP uses 8 teachers per state to form a consensus. TMS's single-teacher
approach is appropriate because the transportation heuristics are more
discrete (waterfall, threshold-based) and have less legitimate
disagreement across methods than inventory policies do.

Scripts (planned, mirroring SCP layout):
- `backend/scripts/pretraining/generate_tms_corpus.py` — per-TRM corpus
- `backend/scripts/pretraining/generate_all_tms_trms.py` — all 11 TRMs

---

## TRM Catalog

TMS has **11 execution TRMs + 1 forecast orchestrator**. The execution
TRMs map to the six action codes defined in `TMSHeuristicDecision`:
`ACCEPT(0), REJECT(1), DEFER(2), ESCALATE(3), MODIFY(4), RETENDER(5),
REROUTE(6), CONSOLIDATE(7), SPLIT(8), REPOSITION(9), HOLD(10)`. Each
TRM uses a subset of these actions.

### Teacher Logic (`forecast_baseline_trm.py:336–429`)

**1. Demand profile classification:**
```
if observations < 26:                            → NEW
elif trend < -0.05 and stage in (decline,eol):   → DECLINING

elif cv < 0.5 and adi > 1.32:                    → INTERMITTENT
elif cv >= 0.5 and adi <= 1.32:                  → ERRATIC
else:                                            → LUMPY
```

**2. Model selection (MODEL_BY_PROFILE):**
```
SMOOTH        → lgbm
ERRATIC       → lgbm_volatility
INTERMITTENT  → croston
LUMPY         → croston
NEW           → holt_winters

## Training Configuration

Identical to SCP spec for architectural consistency:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Architecture | 2-layer MLP (input → 128 → 64 → num_actions) with LayerNorm + Dropout(0.1) |
| Optimizer | AdamW, lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-4 |
| LR Schedule | Cosine annealing over epochs |
| Batch size | 2048 |
| Epochs | 20 |
| Loss | CrossEntropyLoss (+ 0.1× MSE on value head) |
| Validation | 10% holdout |
| Early stop | Best validation loss checkpoint saved |
| Samples per TRM | 50K states × 1 teacher = 50K rows (TMS single-teacher vs SCP's 8-teacher) |
| GPU | RTX 4060 Laptop or equivalent, ~3 seconds per TRM |

## Checkpoint Format

Same as SCP:
```python
{
    "model_state_dict": OrderedDict(...),
    "trm_type": "capacity_promise",
    "state_dim": 14,
    "num_actions": 3,
    "hidden_dim": 128,
}
```
Stored at `/app/models/pretrained/tms_trm_base_v1/trm_{type}.pt`.

## Synthetic Data Generator (Shared with SCP)

Source: `powell/synthetic_trm_data_generator.py`. TMS training samples
use the same underlying generator that SCP uses, with TMS-specific
state builders on top of the transport-oriented scenario archetypes.

### Demand patterns (weighted)
- STABLE 20% · SEASONAL 25% · TRENDING_UP 15% · TRENDING_DOWN 10%
- STEP_CHANGE 10% · PROMOTIONAL 5% · RANDOM 15%

### Phase-aware variance (curriculum)
- Phase 1: variance = 0.15 (tight, teach baseline behavior)
- Phase 2: variance = 0.40 (moderate — carrier reject, weather)
- Phase 3: variance = 0.75 (high — disruptions, peak season chaos)

### Sampled ranges
- Transit lead time: `Normal(3d, 0.9)` clipped to [0.5, 5] days
- Demand CV: `Normal(0.15 + phase_var, σ)` clipped to [0.05, 0.95]
- Initial pipeline: [20, 60]
- Backlog: [0, 10]

### Decision source distribution (training labels)
- EXPERT_HUMAN 40% · AI_ACCEPTED 25% · AI_MODIFIED 15%
- AI_REJECTED 10% · AI_AUTONOMOUS 10%

## Reward Functions

TMS TRMs currently inherit SCP-analogue reward weights from
`DEFAULT_TRM_REWARD_WEIGHTS`. Mappings:

| TMS TRM | SC Proxy | Weights |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Capacity Promise | ATP_EXECUTOR | fill_rate (0.4) + on_time_bonus (0.2) + priority_weight (0.2) + fairness_penalty (0.2) |
| Exception Management | ORDER_TRACKING | detection (0.4) + resolution_speed (0.3) + escalation (0.3) |
| Intermodal Transfer | TO_EXECUTION | on_time_delivery (0.4) + consolidation_bonus (0.3) + cost_efficiency (0.3) |
| Equipment Reposition | REBALANCING | service_improvement (0.5) + transfer_cost_penalty (0.3) + balance_improvement (0.2) |
| Freight Procurement | PO_CREATION | stockout_penalty (0.4) + target_coverage (0.3) + cost (0.2) + timing (0.1) |
| Load Build | ATP_EXECUTOR | fill_rate emphasized; consolidation savings as bonus |
| Dock Scheduling | — | TODO: native TMS weights (dwell, detention, throughput) |
| Broker Routing | PO_CREATION | cost + reliability blend |
| Capacity Buffer | SAFETY_STOCK | service_level_deviation (0.5) + holding_cost (0.3) + excess (0.2) |
| Shipment Tracking | ORDER_TRACKING | detection + resolution + escalation |
| Demand Sensing | FORECAST_ADJUSTMENT | bias_reduction (0.5) + MAPE_improvement (0.3) + stability (0.2) |
| Forecast Baseline | FORECAST_BASELINE | MAPE (0.5) + FVA (0.3) + conformal_coverage (0.2) |

**Open action:** Native TMS reward weights for Dock Scheduling,
Intermodal Transfer, Equipment Reposition, and Load Build should
replace the SC proxies once real transport KPI data is collected.

## Differences From SCP TRM Spec

| Aspect | SCP | TMS |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Teacher consensus | 8 heuristic teachers per state | 1 deterministic teacher per state |
| Samples per TRM | 100K states × 8 = 800K | 50K states × 1 = 50K |
| State source | Inventory tables (MRP, BOM) | Lane/load/shipment/carrier/dock |
| Action semantics | Inventory (order/defer/expedite/cancel) | Waterfall (tender/retender/reroute/escalate) |
| Rewards | Economic: stockout + holding + ordering | Service: fill + detention + consolidation |
| Domain knobs | Lot sizing, SS methods, MOQ | Spot premium, reject rate, detention rate |
| Pretraining origin | CPIM/APICS + SAP MRP lot sizing keys | Carrier industry + waterfall tendering + mode-shift economics |

## Open Items

1. **Native TMS reward weights** — Dock Scheduling, Intermodal Transfer, Equipment Reposition, Load Build currently inherit SC proxies. Need transport-specific KPIs (dwell time, detention dollars, intermodal OTD, fleet utilization).

2. **Phase 2 teachers** — TMS currently uses single-teacher labels. Add secondary teachers (e.g. DAT-benchmark based freight procurement, regulatory-first exception escalation) to introduce multi-teacher consensus matching SCP's approach.

3. **Live backtests** — SCP has a live-data backtest (PO Creation → 99.6% on real SAP decisions). TMS needs the same: a frozen carrier-tender history from an Oracle OTM or SAP TM extract to validate tender waterfall decisions against planner choices.

4. **Training corpus generator** — `generate_all_tms_trms.py` script not yet written; models are conceptually specified but corpus pipeline needs implementation.

5. **Curriculum phases** — Current generator uses SCP's phase variance (0.15 / 0.40 / 0.75). Validate those are appropriate for transportation or tune to reject-rate curves from DAT data.
