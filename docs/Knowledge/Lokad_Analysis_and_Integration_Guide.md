**Purpose**: Distill Lokad's quantitative supply chain methodology and identify specific enhancements for the Autonomy platform

---

## Executive Summary

Lokad is a Paris-based supply chain optimization vendor (est. 2008) that has built a vertically integrated, opinionated technology stack. Their core thesis — that **forecasting and optimization must be unified into a single pipeline producing actionable decisions, not dashboards** — has significant overlap with Autonomy's Powell SDAM framework. However, their architectural choices diverge sharply: Lokad uses a monolithic batch-optimization approach via their proprietary Envision DSL, while Autonomy uses distributed real-time agents (TRM/GNN/LLM).

**Key finding**: Lokad's deepest insight is that the unit of output should be **decisions measured in dollars**, not forecasts measured in accuracy percentages. Autonomy's architecture already embodies this through the TRM agent framework, but the optimization of policy parameters (Powell CFA θ) remains the critical gap. Closing this gap would bring Autonomy's stochastic planning to parity with Lokad's optimization depth while retaining Autonomy's unique advantages in real-time execution, simulation-based training, override learning, and conformal prediction guarantees.

## Part 1: Lokad's Core Philosophy — The Quantitative Supply Chain

### Five Pillars

1. **All Possible Futures** — Replace single-point forecasts with full probability distributions acknowledging irreducible uncertainty. "Every single decision is scored against all possible futures according to economic drivers."

2. **All Feasible Decisions** — Enumerate physically valid options (respecting MOQ, shelf space, weight limits, expiration dates). Not 1.3 units — either 1 or 2.

3. **Economic Drivers** — Measure everything in dollars, never percentages. Include second-order consequences (customer loyalty, habit formation, market perception). "The only things that actually improve a supply chain are the decisions that have a tangible, physical impact."

4. **End-to-End Robotization** — Automate routine decisions to return control to humans. Replace spreadsheet armies with reliable numerical recipes.

5. **Supply Chain Scientist** — One accountable person owns quantitative performance. Not a data scientist focused on methods, but someone versed in operational nuance who understands financial consequences.

### Mapping to Autonomy

| Lokad Pillar | Autonomy Equivalent | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| All Possible Futures | Monte Carlo (1000+ scenarios), 20 distribution types, conformal prediction | None — strong alignment |
| All Feasible Decisions | TRM agents enumerate discrete actions | Marginal ROI ranking not yet implemented |
| Economic Drivers | Probabilistic Balanced Scorecard (Financial, Customer, Operational, Strategic) | Loss functions use MSE, not economic costs |
| Robotization | Agentic operating model (agents own decisions by default) | None — strong alignment |
| Supply Chain Scientist | No direct equivalent | N/A — different business model |

## Part 2: Lokad's Contrarian Positions (and Autonomy's Response)

### 2.1 Safety Stock: "Fundamentally Flawed"

**Lokad's position**: "We strongly advise not to use any safety stock model."

**Specific criticisms**:
- Normal distribution assumption is wrong: "Neither future demand nor future lead time are normally distributed"
- Ignores portfolio competition: "All SKUs compete for the same resources" — treating each independently is suboptimal
- Historical artifact: "Designed as a hack for coping with limitations of early computers"

**Lokad's alternative**: Probabilistic lead demand distributions → marginal economic return per unit → fill from highest ROI down until budget/capacity binds.

**Autonomy's position**: Already partially aligned. `InventoryBufferTRM` treats the buffer as an "uncertainty absorber, NOT a hard demand target for MRP." The `sl_fitted` policy uses Monte Carlo DDLT for non-Normal distributions. However, the platform still offers `abs_level` and basic `sl` policies that rely on Normal assumptions.

**Action**: Implement marginal economic return scoring as a 5th policy type (`econ_optimal`). See Part 5 Priority #1.

### 2.2 ABC Analysis: "Actively Harmful"

**Lokad's position**: ABC classification is an antipattern.
- Between 25-50% of items change category every quarter
- "Even a trivial indicator like 'total units sold last year' carries more information than ABC class"
- Misses demand dynamics, economic importance, and creates bikeshedding

**Lokad's alternative**: Continuous item scoring functions.

**Autonomy's action**: If product classification is ever exposed in the UI, use continuous scoring (e.g., expected annual revenue × margin × criticality), not ABC buckets. The `HierarchicalMetricsService` should support continuous importance weighting.

### 2.3 EOQ: "Obsolete"

**Lokad's position**: "We do not recommend the EOQ concept anymore."
- Ordering costs are negligible with modern EDI/software
- Ignores price breaks entirely
- Mathematical assumptions no longer valid

**Lokad's alternative**: Numerical optimization over arbitrary cost/discount functions. Modified cost: `C*(q) = (1/2)(q - δ - 1)H + Z × P(q)` where volume discount functions are explored numerically.

**Autonomy's action**: Replace analytic EOQ in lot sizing with numerical cost optimization. This fits naturally into the Monte Carlo framework — evaluate total cost for each candidate order quantity across probability scenarios.

### 2.4 Service Levels: "Wrong Framing"

**Lokad's position**: Fixed service level targets are the wrong abstraction. The 100% service level target is a named antipattern ("mathematically requires infinite inventory").

**Key distinction**: Fill rate ≠ service level. A bookstore with 95% service level can have 50% fill rate (small orders succeed, bulk orders fail systematically).

**Lokad's alternative**: "Probabilistic forecasting entirely removes the need to optimize service levels." Directly optimize economic return per marginal unit.

**Autonomy's action**: The `sl` policy type (z-score based) remains useful as a constraint boundary, but the primary optimization should target economic outcomes. The `InventoryBufferTRM` already uses VFA which inherently optimizes economic outcomes.

### 2.5 S&OP: "Resource-Destructive"

**Lokad's position**: Traditional S&OP is too slow (monthly cycles revert to quarterly), consumes rather than invests human resources, and relies on simplistic forecasting.

**Autonomy's response**: Strong differentiator. The S&OP GraphSAGE agent + Agentic Consensus Board replaces human-committee S&OP with machine-speed consensus. Functional agents negotiate policy parameters using feed-back signals as evidence. This is ahead of both traditional S&OP and Lokad's approach (which lacks multi-agent consensus).

### 2.6 DDMRP: "Improvements on the Wrong Baseline"

**Lokad's position**: Mixed. Acknowledges frequential forecasting (demand in days vs temporal units) is genuinely superior for intermittent demand. But criticizes DDMRP for comparing itself to MRP (not a meaningful baseline), lacking formalism, one-dimensional prioritization (only buffer targets), and optimizing percentages not dollars.

**Autonomy's response**: Already positioned correctly. `InventoryBufferTRM` uses VFA (optimizes economic outcomes, not just stock targets). Multi-TRM hive avoids one-dimensional prioritization with 11 specialized agents.

### 2.7 Manual Forecast Corrections: "Broken System Signal"

**Lokad's position**: "There is zero reason to think that, when given the same data inputs, an automated system cannot outperform a human who realistically won't have more than a few seconds to spare."

**Autonomy's nuanced response**: This validates the agentic operating model but conflicts with the override effectiveness tracking system. The resolution: override learning IS the mechanism that makes manual corrections unnecessary over time. The Bayesian Beta posteriors learn which overrides help vs hurt, progressively shifting the 95/5 boundary until agents handle everything.

### 2.8 "Naked Forecasts" Antipattern

**Lokad's definition**: Pursuing forecast accuracy without connecting to decisions. "The only metrics that matter are measured in dollars or euros and are associated to mundane decisions."

**Autonomy's action**: Ensure all forecast evaluation surfaces economic impact metrics alongside statistical accuracy. The Balanced Scorecard framework already does this, but frontend pages should lead with dollar impact, not MAPE.

## Part 3: Lokad's Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Probabilistic Forecasting Evolution

| Year | Approach | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 2008 | Classic time series | ARIMA, exponential smoothing, model selector |
| 2012 | Quantile forecasts | Native quantile estimation aligned with asymmetric business costs |
| 2015 | Quantile grids | Full probability mass functions: P(demand=0), P(demand=1), ... P(demand=K) |
| 2016 | Full probabilistic | Joint demand + lead time + yield uncertainty distributions |
| 2018 | Deep learning | Single model, tens of millions of parameters, multi-series cross-correlation |

**Key technical detail**: Quantile grids are **non-parametric** — they store discrete PMFs per product-location-period with no distributional assumptions. Fundamentally different from fitting Normal/Gamma/Weibull then extracting quantiles.

**Censored demand handling**: Stockouts flagged as censored (true demand was higher), promotions flagged as inflated. Neither is rewritten or excluded — both serve as informative observations in the model.

### 3.2 Optimization Pipeline

**Three generations**:

1. **Stochastic Discrete Descent (SDD, 2021)**: Solves integer variable optimization by introducing continuous parameterization, optimizing via SGD, projecting back to integers. Handles millions of variables with probabilistic forecasts directly.

2. **Latent Optimization (2024)**: For combinatorial problems (scheduling, resource allocation), operates in "strategy space" rather than "solution space." Learns a high-dimensional parameterization of a simple solver, iteratively refines parameters. Millions of variables, re-optimization within seconds.

3. **Quantile grid consumption**: Evaluates every decision against every scenario probability. `expected_value = Σ P(demand=k) × outcome(decision, k)`. Decisions ranked by marginal ROI.

### 3.3 Differentiable Programming

Lokad merges ML and numerical optimization into a single differentiable framework:

| Aspect | Deep Learning | Differentiable Programming |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Purpose | Learning only | Learning + Optimization |
| Training | Learn-once, Eval-many | Learn-once, Eval-once |
| Data | Homogeneous (images, audio) | Heterogeneous (relational tables, time series) |
| Programs | Static tensor graphs | Arbitrary programs |

**Key insight**: 2-3 orders of magnitude speed advantage over MIP solvers via GPU gradient-based optimization, at the cost of no mathematical optimality guarantee.

### 3.4 Envision DSL

Purpose-built language for supply chain optimization:
- Compiles to bytecode for distributed execution on "Thunks" VM
- First-class "algebra of random variables" (arithmetic on distributions produces distributions)
- Defense-in-depth security (no OS access, no SQL injection, no arbitrary code execution)
- Targets supply chain analysts, not software engineers

**Autonomy's position**: Do NOT build a DSL. Lokad's Envision is their core moat requiring 18 years of investment. Autonomy's equivalent capability comes from: (a) Powell policy parameters exposed in admin UI, (b) Claude Skills with SKILL.md rules, (c) synthetic data wizard. However, the **algebra of random variables** concept is worth adopting (see Part 5 Priority #6).

### 3.5 Infrastructure

- **No relational database**: Event sourcing (append-only) + content-addressable store (CAS) for columnar data
- **Custom distributed VM** (Thunks): Envision bytecode execution across clusters
- **Minimal dependencies**: ~10× fewer third-party libraries than typical enterprise software
- **Languages**: F#, C#, TypeScript (no Python)
- **Cloud**: 100% Azure
- **Multi-tenancy**: First-class data partitioning as architectural primitive

### 3.6 Data Ingestion

- **Raw transactional extracts**: No preprocessing; all data preparation in-platform
- **2+1 incremental rule**: Each daily extract covers last 2 complete weeks + current week (automatic self-healing if extraction fails)
- **Anti-pattern**: Never extract from BI systems (pre-aggregated data loses transactional detail)
- **Philosophy**: "Bad data is rare" in transactional systems; embrace noise probabilistically rather than reject imperfect data

---

## Part 4: Lokad's Key Metrics and Techniques

### 4.1 CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score)

**Formula**: `CRPS(F, x) = ∫(F(y) − 𝟙(y − x))² dy`

- Evaluates full probability distributions, not just point forecasts
- When applied to deterministic forecasts, reduces to MAE (backward compatible)
- Unlike pinball loss (single quantile), CRPS considers the entire distribution
- Same units as the observed variable (interpretable)

**Autonomy action**: Add CRPS alongside conformal prediction metrics as the primary probabilistic forecast quality score.

### 4.2 Pinball Loss

**Formula**: `L(q, y) = q×max(y−ŷ, 0) + (1−q)×max(ŷ−y, 0)` where q is the target quantile

- Evaluates accuracy at specific quantiles
- Asymmetric penalty reflecting business costs of over vs under-estimation
- Useful for evaluating P10/P50/P90 accuracy individually

### 4.3 Prioritized Ordering

Lokad's replacement for safety stock + reorder point:
1. Compute marginal ROI for every possible additional unit across all products
2. Sort globally by marginal ROI (highest to lowest)
3. Fill from top down until budget/capacity/warehouse constraint binds
4. Refresh daily

**Properties**: Accommodates constraints naturally (warehouse capacity = truncation point), produces smooth transitions (no "jumps" in stock levels), reduces scheduling friction (works with container loads without manual intervention).

### 4.4 Decision-Driven Optimization

Core principle: "Forecasts are intrinsically entangled with their underlying decisions."
- Never decouple forecasting from optimization (Antipattern #6)
- Measure success in dollars/euros, not accuracy statistics
- Forecast accuracy is "a debugging artifact" — useful during development, not a business metric

### 4.5 Negative Knowledge

"Understanding what does NOT work is more durable and valuable than knowing what works."
- Positive knowledge is ephemeral and easily obsolete
- Negative knowledge is durable, grounded in human nature, transfers across contexts
- Maps to Autonomy's override effectiveness tracking (Bayesian posteriors learn which interventions systematically fail)

## Part 5: Priority Enhancements for Autonomy (Ranked by Impact)

### Priority 1 — Scenario-Based CFA Optimization (HIGH IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT)

**What**: Implement optimization over Monte Carlo scenarios to extract optimal policy parameters θ.

**Why**: The CLAUDE.md explicitly identifies this gap: "Current platform uses Monte Carlo for evaluation; Powell recommends optimization over scenarios to extract optimal policy parameters." This is the single biggest gap between Autonomy and Lokad's capability.

**How**: For each candidate θ (safety stock multipliers, reorder points, lot sizes), run Monte Carlo evaluation. Use gradient-free optimization (CMA-ES via `cmaes` package, or Bayesian optimization via `botorch`) to search for θ that maximizes the expected Balanced Scorecard objective.

**Implementation path**:
1. Define `PolicyParameterVector` class encapsulating all tunable θ per config
2. Create `CFAOptimizer` service that wraps Monte Carlo evaluation in an objective function
3. Use CMA-ES (population-based, handles noisy objectives well) to search θ space
4. Persist optimal θ to `powell_policy_parameters` table
5. Schedule optimization runs in `relearning_jobs.py` (weekly cadence)

**Files to modify**: New service `backend/app/services/cfa_optimizer.py`, extend `stochastic_sampler.py` to accept parameterized θ, add scheduler entry in `relearning_jobs.py`

### Priority 2 — Economic Loss Functions for TRM Training (HIGH IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

**What**: Replace generic MSE loss in TRM training with asymmetric economic loss functions.

**Why**: Lokad's core insight that optimization should be measured in dollars applies directly to how TRMs learn. A stockout costs 4× more than holding excess inventory — the loss function should reflect this.

**How**: Define loss as:
```python
loss = holding_cost * max(0, inventory) + stockout_cost * max(0, -inventory) + ordering_cost * orders
```
These are differentiable, asymmetric, and economically grounded.

**Implementation path**: Modify `TRMTrainer.compute_loss()` to accept configurable economic parameters from `InvPolicy` cost fields. Parameterize holding/stockout/ordering cost ratios per product-location.

**Files to modify**: `backend/app/services/powell/trm_trainer.py`

### Priority 3 — Marginal ROI Ranking for PO Decisions (HIGH IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT)

**What**: Transform PO creation from local (per product-location) to global optimization. Compute marginal expected value for each additional unit across ALL products, fill from highest ROI down until constraint binds.

**Why**: Lokad's "master purchase priority list" is their most powerful operational concept. Instead of making independent PO decisions, each TRM agent decision competes globally for scarce resources (budget, warehouse capacity, supplier capacity).

**How**: Maps to Powell's CFA with knapsack-style parameterization. The `POCreationTRM` computes marginal value per unit, the allocation layer sorts globally and assigns.

**Implementation path**: Extend `AllocationService` to support budget-constrained global PO prioritization. Add `marginal_roi` field to `powell_po_decisions`.

### Priority 4 — Non-Parametric Demand Distributions (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

**What**: Support empirical probability mass functions (PMFs) for intermittent/lumpy demand alongside parametric fitting.

**Why**: Lokad's quantile grid approach stores P(demand=0), P(demand=1), ... P(demand=K) directly — no distributional assumptions. This is superior for slow-moving SKUs where no parametric distribution fits well.

**How**: Add `DemandModel.EMPIRICAL_PMF` to enums. Store PMF as JSONB in the `forecast` table. Extend `stochastic_sampler.py` to sample from empirical PMFs.

**Files to modify**: `backend/app/services/stochastic/stochastic_sampler.py`, `backend/app/models/aws_sc_planning.py` (add JSONB column)

### Priority 5 — Censored Demand Detection (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

**What**: Flag periods where stockouts censored true demand. Exclude or up-weight censored periods in distribution fitting.

**Why**: When inventory hits zero, observed demand is a lower bound of true demand. Including these periods as-is systematically underestimates demand, leading to chronic understocking.

**How**: Add `is_demand_censored` boolean to the `forecast` table, populated by comparing `inv_level.on_hand_qty <= 0` against forecast periods. The `demand_processor.py` and `distribution_fitter.py` should either exclude censored periods or use survival analysis techniques.

**Files to modify**: `backend/app/services/aws_sc_planning/demand_processor.py`, `backend/app/services/stochastic/distribution_fitter.py`, migration for new column

### Priority 6 — StochasticValue Algebra (MEDIUM IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT)

**What**: Create a Python class that wraps distribution parameters and overloads arithmetic operators to propagate uncertainty through calculations.

**Why**: Lokad's Envision has first-class random variable types where `demand_over_lead_time = demand_per_day * lead_time_days` automatically computes the convolution. This would simplify Autonomy's stochastic planning code significantly.

**How**:
```python
class StochasticValue:
    def __init__(self, distribution, params):
        self.distribution = distribution
        self.params = params

    def __add__(self, other):
        # Compute convolution or Monte Carlo addition
        ...

    def __mul__(self, other):
        # Compute product distribution
        ...

    def quantile(self, q):
        # Extract quantile from resulting distribution
        ...
```

**Files to create**: `backend/app/services/stochastic/stochastic_value.py`

### Priority 7 — CRPS as Primary Forecast Metric (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

**What**: Add CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score) alongside existing conformal prediction metrics as the primary probabilistic forecast quality score.

**Why**: CRPS is the gold standard for evaluating probabilistic forecasts — same units as the variable, backward-compatible with MAE for deterministic forecasts, evaluates full distributions (not just specific quantiles).

**Formula**: `CRPS(F, x) = ∫(F(y) − 𝟙(y ≥ x))² dy`

For discrete distributions: `CRPS(F, x) = Σ F(yₖ)² + Σ (F(yₖ) − 1)²` split at observed value x.

**Files to modify**: `backend/app/services/conformal_orchestrator.py` (add CRPS computation), forecast evaluation endpoints

### Priority 8 — Log-Logistic Distribution for Lead Times (LOW IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

**What**: Add log-logistic as a candidate distribution in the distribution fitter, specifically targeting lead time data.

**Why**: Lokad identifies log-logistic (params: α=median, β=shape) as superior for lead times due to its fat-tailed properties. More realistic than Normal or even Lognormal for capturing extreme lead time events.

**Files to modify**: `backend/app/services/stochastic/distribution_fitter.py`

### Priority 9 — Censored Lead Time Handling (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

**What**: When computing lead times from historical PO data, account for in-transit/pending orders as lower bounds rather than ignoring them.

**Why**: If you only measure completed orders, you bias lead time estimates downward. Pending orders that haven't arrived yet provide valuable information: the true lead time is at LEAST as long as the time elapsed so far. Lokad specifically highlights this as a significant accuracy improvement.

**How**: Use conditional probability / survival analysis. For pending orders, contribute P(lead_time > elapsed_time) to the likelihood rather than excluding.

**Files to modify**: `backend/app/services/stochastic/distribution_fitter.py` (add censored observation support)

### Priority 10 — PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for Tenant Isolation (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

**What**: Add RLS policies to enforce tenant isolation at the database level, complementing application-layer `tenant_id` filtering.

**Why**: Lokad emphasizes "partitioning as a first-class citizen" preventing cross-tenant data leaks. Currently Autonomy enforces tenant isolation only at the API dependency layer. An application bug could expose cross-tenant data. RLS provides defense-in-depth.

**How**: `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON ... USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::int);`

### Priority 11 — Self-Healing Incremental Extractions (LOW IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

**What**: Implement Lokad's "2+1 rule" in SAP ingestion: each daily extract covers the last 2 complete weeks plus the current week.

**Why**: If an extraction fails, the next day's overlapping window automatically recovers the missed data. No manual intervention needed.

**Files to modify**: `backend/app/services/sap_ingestion_monitoring_service.py`

### Priority 12 — Time-Series Table Partitioning (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

**What**: Add PostgreSQL native partitioning (`PARTITION BY RANGE`) to `forecast`, `inv_level`, and `supply_plan` tables.

**Why**: These tables grow large over time. The common access pattern ("last N periods for config X") benefits enormously from time-based partitioning — PostgreSQL can skip entire partitions.

## Part 6: What Lokad Gets Wrong (Autonomy's Advantages)

### 6.1 No Agent Architecture
Lokad's optimization is batch-oriented (daily Envision scripts), not real-time decision-making. They have no equivalent to TRM agents (<10ms inference), GNN world model, or multi-tier Powell framework. Autonomy's real-time execution is a genuine differentiator.

### 6.2 No Simulation / Digital Twin
Lokad has no Beer Game equivalent for training, validation, or confidence building. Their optimization is purely historical-data-driven. Autonomy's 5-phase digital twin training pipeline (BC warm-start → coordinated traces → stochastic stress-testing → copilot calibration → CDC relearning) is unmatched.

### 6.3 No Override Learning
Lokad dismisses manual corrections entirely ("if humans need to override, the system is broken"). Autonomy captures override patterns via Bayesian Beta posteriors and uses them to improve AI. This is a genuine moat — the judgment layer from human expertise becomes a compounding advantage.

### 6.4 No Conformal Prediction
Lokad uses proprietary probabilistic methods but provides no distribution-free statistical guarantees. Autonomy's CDT (Conformal Decision Theory) on every TRM decision provides provable coverage guarantees with `risk_bound = P(loss > τ)`.

### 6.5 No Multi-Agent Consensus
Lokad's approach is monolithic optimization. Autonomy's Agentic Authorization Protocol (AAP) and Agentic Consensus Board enable cross-functional trade-off evaluation at machine speed — 25+ negotiation scenarios across manufacturing, distribution, procurement, logistics, and finance.

### 6.6 Single-Vendor Dependency
Lokad's "Supply Chain Scientists" model means the vendor owns the implementation. Autonomy's platform model lets customers own their planning logic.

### 6.7 Dismisses Human Expertise
Lokad's "zero reason to think humans can outperform automated systems" position is theoretically correct for routine decisions but ignores domain expertise for novel situations. Autonomy's hybrid TRM + Claude Skills architecture (95% automated, 5% exception handling) is more pragmatic and captures the long tail of unusual situations.

## Part 8: Lokad's Agentic AI Critique (Blog, Jan 2025)

Lokad published a skeptical analysis of agentic AI for supply chain (Jan 2025). Key arguments:

1. **LLMs lack numerical precision** — Cannot reliably compute inventory positions or lead time convolutions
2. **Hallucination risk** — Unacceptable for financial supply chain decisions
3. **Cost at scale** — LLM inference costs are too high for millions of daily SKU-level decisions
4. **No structured optimization** — LLMs cannot perform the gradient-based optimization that supply chain requires

**Autonomy's response**: These criticisms apply to LLM-only approaches but NOT to Autonomy's hybrid architecture:
- TRMs handle 95% of decisions at <10ms with no hallucination risk (deterministic neural inference)
- Claude Skills only activate for the 5% exception cases where cost is acceptable
- GNN provides structured optimization, not LLM reasoning
- Conformal prediction provides statistical guarantees that LLMs alone cannot offer

This is actually a competitive positioning advantage — Autonomy can cite Lokad's own criticism of "agentic AI" as validation of the hybrid approach: "We agree with Lokad that LLMs alone cannot handle supply chain optimization. That's why our primary execution path uses 7M-parameter TRM agents, not LLMs."
