# TMS Twin Rewrite Plan

**Status:** active, started 2026-05-01.
**Owner:** TMS team (acer-nitro session).
**Supersedes:** [PHASE_A_TWIN_AUDIT.md](PHASE_A_TWIN_AUDIT.md) — its "extend
`dag_simpy_simulator.py` with `step` + action injection" roadmap is dropped
in favour of replacing the simulator entirely with two new files (lane-flow
simulator + shipment generator).
**Architecture source:** [Autonomy-Core/docs/architecture/TWIN_AND_ENVELOPES.md](../../Autonomy-Core/docs/architecture/TWIN_AND_ENVELOPES.md).
The cross-plane structure (generator/simulator split, three-phase implementation
ladder, canonical envelope contracts) is decided in Core; this doc is the
TMS-side execution plan only.

## 1. Why we're rewriting

[backend/app/services/dag_simpy_simulator.py](../backend/app/services/dag_simpy_simulator.py)
is a 1,252-line near-clone of SCP's inventory simulator. It models on-hand,
in-transit, backlog, safety stock, BOM explosion, and supplier reliability —
none of which the TMS plane decides over. TMS decides over carrier movement:
load assignment, dispatch timing, equipment balance, dock scheduling.

Per [TWIN_AND_ENVELOPES.md §3](../../Autonomy-Core/docs/architecture/TWIN_AND_ENVELOPES.md),
TMS's twin state node is `(lane × carrier × equipment × hour-or-day)`. Its
action is load assignment + carrier + dock + reposition. Its physics is HOS,
dock slots, carrier capacity, equipment flow. None of that is in the existing
simulator and bolting it on top of inventory physics is the wrong factoring.

## 2. The new shape

Per [TWIN_AND_ENVELOPES.md §4](../../Autonomy-Core/docs/architecture/TWIN_AND_ENVELOPES.md):

| Artefact | File | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Shipment generator** | `backend/app/services/digital_twin/shipment_generator.py` | Exogenous `TransferOrderEnvelope` arrival stream — line items per (origin, destination, product, bucket). |
| **Lane-flow simulator** | `backend/app/services/digital_twin/lane_flow_simulator.py` | Transition function over generator output: lane queues, dock dynamics, carrier capacity, equipment flow. |
| **Step adapter** | `backend/app/services/digital_twin/step_adapter.py` | `(observe, step, record)` façade producing RL trajectories — parallel to Core's `TwinStepAdapter`. |
| **Observation / Action / Reward** | `backend/app/services/digital_twin/observations.py` | TMS-shaped dataclasses. Will migrate to subclass Core's `TwinObservation` once Core slims it (Core PR per TWIN_AND_ENVELOPES.md §9 bullet 3 — not blocking). |

Schemas (the `TransferOrder` and `TransferOrderLineItem` shape) stay in Core
(`azirella-data-model`). The cross-plane envelope contract package
(`azirella-transfer-order-envelope-contract`) is also Core. This product repo
owns generator + simulator only.

## 3. Load Builder — where it gets material data

The Load Builder agent decides at line-item grain (SKU, weight, volume,
hazmat, due date). It needs to see what shipments arrived to be loaded — but
**not** how they got reordered upstream.

`shipment_generator.py` is exactly that source. It emits
`TransferOrderEnvelope` rows (line-item-grain) under the three-phase ladder:

- **Phase 1 (PR-2):** parametric stochastic stub — broad coverage, no upstream
  dependency. Lane mix, mode mix, weight/volume distributions, weekly cadence.
- **Phase 2 (PR-6):** parameters fitted to the tenant's `TransferOrderLineItem`
  history. Realistic for that tenant.
- **Phase 3 (later):** SCP's producer registers when SCP+TMS deployed jointly.
  TMS code is unchanged.

The lane-flow simulator never simulates inventory; it consumes whatever the
shipment generator emits.

## 4. PR sequence

| # | Scope | Behaviour change |
|---|---|---|
| **PR-1** | Scaffolding: subpackage `digital_twin/`, dataclasses, generator + simulator shells, Core pin bump. Phase-1 stub returns an empty envelope (zero rows) to wire the contract end-to-end. | None. `dag_simpy_simulator.py` still in place and unmodified. |
| **PR-2** | Phase-1 parametric `shipment_generator.py`: lane/mode mix, weight/volume distributions, weekly cadence, seasonal volume modulation. Adopts Core's `SeasonalEnvelope` ([MIGRATION_REGISTER §3.20](../../Autonomy-Core/docs/MIGRATION_REGISTER.md)) on the generator side. | New: shipment events flow. Verify Load Builder consumes them. |
| **PR-3** | Phase-1 `lane_flow_simulator.py`: lane queues, dock dynamics, carrier capacity, equipment flow. Action injection for load build / carrier / dispatch / reposition. Per-step reward (OTD%, cost-per-load, dock utilisation, equipment balance). | New: end-to-end RL training loop runs. Old simulator still callable behind a flag. |
| **PR-4** | `SeasonalEnvelope` Phase-C adoption — sin/cos period features in `LaneFlowObservation`, regime-stratified scenarios. | Twin observations carry seasonal context. |
| **PR-5** | Delete `dag_simpy_simulator.py`. Drop the feature flag. Update [PHASE_A_TWIN_AUDIT.md](PHASE_A_TWIN_AUDIT.md) status. | Old simulator gone. |
| **PR-6** | Phase-2 calibration — fit shipment generator parameters to tenant `TransferOrderLineItem` history. | Tenant-realistic training. |

Phase-3 producer coupling is not in TMS scope. When SCP ships its producer,
TMS swaps the registered provider with no code change.

## 5. Core dependencies adopted

PR-1 bumps the Core pin (`30549c4` → `08c6429`) and adds two new package
pins:

- `azirella-transfer-order-envelope-contract` — the `TransferOrderEnvelope`
  schema TMS produces under the producer signature `tms:to_arrival_stub:v0.1.0`.
- `azirella-demand-planning-contract` — transitive dep of the contract package
  (carries the shared `Tier` enum).

Optional adoption (per [Core CONSUMER_ADOPTION_LOG](../../Autonomy-Core/docs/CONSUMER_ADOPTION_LOG.md)
2026-05-01 entries): `DisruptionKind` extensions (`CARRIER_STRIKE`,
`DOCK_CONGESTION`, `WEATHER_EVENT`) and `ScenarioSampler.product_scopes=("tms",)`.
Wired in PR-3 alongside the simulator.
