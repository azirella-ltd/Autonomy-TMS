IntermodalTransferTRM — Mode-Shift Eligibility & Economic Viability (BUILD)

Tenth TMS-native TRM. Completes the BUILD phase alongside LoadBuildTRM (#9).

Evaluates whether a TMSShipment currently planned for truck (FTL / LTL)
should shift to intermodal (truck+rail / rail-carload / ocean). Emits
ACCEPT (proceed with intermodal) or REJECT (stay on truck) based on
the Oracle-OTM / J.B. Hunt 360 pattern.

Trigger entity: `TMSShipment` (typically DRAFT or PLANNED status, before
carrier tender). One evaluation per shipment per request. Intermodal
evaluation is an option-pricing question — the planner or upstream
orchestration supplies the candidate intermodal route + rate, and this
TRM says GO / NO-GO.

v1 design note: the intermodal network (ramp catalog, intermodal
rate-sheet, ramp-congestion feed) is not yet in TMS. The service
therefore accepts the intermodal-specific inputs as explicit overrides
on the endpoint — matching how Oracle OTM's mode-shift evaluator is
called from the optimizer. When the intermodal network lands in Sprint 2,
the state-builder will fill these in from canonical state.

Hard gates (heuristic REJECTs immediately):

1. Hazmat freight (rail restrictions) → REJECT
2. Temperature-controlled (limited reefer intermodal availability) → REJECT
3. Ramp distance > 100 miles either end (drayage kills economics) → REJECT
4. Lane < 500 miles (below intermodal breakeven) → REJECT
5. Ramp congestion > 70% → REJECT
6. Transit time exceeds delivery window → REJECT
7. Reliability < 80% with window < 2 days → REJECT

Soft evaluation:

- Drayage-decomposed all-in cost vs truck rate, with inventory
  carrying-cost adjustment (44,000 lb × 10%/365 × penalty_days).
- 8% savings threshold (5% on long-haul > 800 mi) to ACCEPT.

Observational v1 — no TMSShipment mutation. ACCEPT decisions are logged
at INFO severity; REJECT at INFO with rationale. The mode-change
write-path lands alongside PREPARE.3's dual-write to core.agent_decisions
with decision_type=INTERMODAL_TRANSFER.
