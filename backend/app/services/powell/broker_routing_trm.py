BrokerRoutingTRM — Broker vs Asset-Carrier Routing (ACQUIRE phase)

Fifth TMS-native TRM. Maps to SCP's `subcontracting` slot. Fires on
Loads that have exhausted their contract-carrier waterfall — when the
primary carriers declined or expired their tenders, this TRM decides:
- ACCEPT a specific broker + rate (broker id + premium recorded)
- ESCALATE for human intervention (no broker available OR rate exceeds
  urgency-adjusted threshold)

Action space (from Core dispatch):
  ACCEPT   — broker selected; the Core heuristic already picked the
             reliability-adjusted-cost winner and validated its premium
             vs DAT benchmark / market / time-urgency thresholds.
  ESCALATE — no broker available OR best broker's rate exceeds the
             effective threshold (market tightness + time urgency
             widens the threshold, but extreme premiums still escalate
             for approval).

No Load.status mutation in v1. The authoritative tender artefact remains
the FreightTender row; when BrokerRouting returns ACCEPT, the caller
creates a new FreightTender with the broker carrier_id + rate. Log-only
for v1 — PREPARE.3's dual-write to core.agent_decisions with
decision_type=BROKER_ROUTING lands Sprint 1 Week 4-5.

Feature-vector sources (v1):
- load_id / lane_id / mode / hours_to_pickup ← Load
- tender_attempts_exhausted ← count(FreightTender where not ACCEPTED)
- all_contract_carriers_declined ← every non-ACCEPTED tender has status
  ∈ {DECLINED, EXPIRED, REJECTED}
- available_brokers ← Carrier rows where carrier_type == BROKER (joined
  with latest FreightRate on their active CarrierLane). Each entry
  carries {id, name, rate, reliability, coverage_score}.
- contract_rate ← last ACCEPTED tender's rate on this lane (fallback to
  any ACCEPTED tender rate on this Load; else 0 and the dispatcher
  infers benchmark from broker rates)
- market_tightness / spot_rate / broker_rate_premium_pct / dat_benchmark
  → honest priors (0.5 / 0 / 0.15 / 0) until market-data integration
  lands
- shipment_priority / is_customer_committed → default 3 / False
- budget_remaining → 0 (no budget tracking in TMS today)

Seed-data caveat: no BROKER-type carriers exist in the acer-nitro seed
DB today (7 ASSET, 1 THREE_PL). Every load in acer-nitro's current
state will return ESCALATE("No brokers available"). Once a broker row
is seeded (CarrierType.BROKER) with a FreightRate on the load's lane,
the full decision path exercises.
