LoadBuildTRM — Shipment→Load consolidation (BUILD phase)

Seventh TMS-native TRM. Maps to SCP's `mo_execution` slot but operates
on freight consolidation — "should these N shipments travel as one FTL
load?" — rather than manufacturing-order execution.

Action space (from Core dispatch):
  ACCEPT      — route single shipment as LTL / accept current FTL plan
  CONSOLIDATE — combine N shipments into one multi-stop load
  SPLIT       — over-capacity, delivery-window conflict, or >max_stops
  DEFER       — underutilized single shipment; hold for consolidation
                window (default 24h)
  REJECT      — hazmat / temperature incompatibility

No TMSShipment.status mutation in v1. The authoritative Load
creation belongs to a separate workflow; this TRM advises the
CONSOLIDATE decision. Log-only (PREPARE.3 dual-write lands Sprint 1
Week 4-5).

Trigger grouping: DRAFT shipments clustered by
(origin_site_id, destination_site_id, mode, date(requested_pickup_date)).
Each group is one TRM evaluation. A group of size 1 still evaluates —
the TRM can return ACCEPT (LTL-best) or DEFER (underutilized, wait
for more).

Feature-vector sources (v1):
- shipment_ids / lane_id / mode / equipment_type ← group
- total_weight / total_volume / total_pallets / shipment_count ← SUM
- has_hazmat_conflict ← any shipment in group hazmat=True AND mixed
- has_temp_conflict ← any shipment is_temperature_sensitive AND temp
  ranges incompatible within the group
- earliest_pickup / latest_pickup ← MIN/MAX of requested_pickup_date
- stop_count ← COUNT(DISTINCT destination_site_id) in group
- delivery_windows_compatible ← latest_delivery span ≤ 24h
- ftl_rate ← FreightRate.rate_flat for this lane+mode (honest fallback
  $2500 matches FreightProcurement seed)
- ltl_rate_sum ← SUM(weight/100 × DEFAULT_LTL_PER_CWT) per shipment
- consolidation_savings ← max(0, ltl_rate_sum - ftl_rate)

Honest defaults (wire up as data/configuration arrives):
- max_weight = 44000 lbs, max_volume = 2700 cuft, max_pallets = 26
  (FTL 53ft dry-van standard)
- max_stops = 3 (industry consolidation norm)
- stop_off_charge_per_stop = $75
- consolidation_window_hours = 24
- ltl_class_rate_per_cwt = 0.25 ($/cwt × 100 lbs = $25 per 10K lbs base)
- volume_ltl_rate = 0.0
