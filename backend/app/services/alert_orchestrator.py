"""TMS Alert Orchestrator — §3.62 Phase 3.

Plane-side orchestrator for the unified Risk Engine. TMS canonical
state (ShipmentLeg actual vs planned timestamps, ForecastException
demand-variance signals) maps into Core's ``Alert`` ORM via this
module. Plane-specific TRMs / dashboards consume from the unified
``risk_alerts`` table.

Phase 3 scope:

* ``detect_carrier_reliability(lane_id, carrier_id)`` — concrete
  demonstration of the plane-orchestrator-over-Core-detector pattern.
  Reads ShipmentLeg rows for a (lane, carrier) cohort, computes
  realised transit times, feeds into Core's ``variance_reliability``,
  and persists an Alert(type=VARIANCE_RELIABILITY, plane=TRANSPORT)
  row when the cohort's CV% crosses the configured threshold.

* ``TMSRiskInputAdapter`` — type-checkable adapter that wires TMS
  entity keys (``(lane_id, carrier_id)``) to Core detector input
  dataclasses. Today only implements
  ``to_variance_reliability_input``; ``to_supply_risk_input`` and
  ``to_excess_capacity_input`` raise NotImplementedError (TMS has no
  inventory-style supply-risk surface yet; they'll be wired when
  TMS gains buffer / capacity entities).

* Severity ladder + recommended-action copy stay plane-side (TMS
  policy on what "high CV%" means for carrier selection differs
  from SCP's vendor-lead-time policy).

Sibling cleanup landed alongside (§3.62 Phase 3 follow-up,
2026-05-12):

* ``ConditionAlert`` ORM retired — no producer existed, 0 rows;
  ``executive_briefing_service`` was retargeted to read from Core's
  unified ``Alert`` table joined through ``supply_chain_configs``.

* TMS ``ForecastException`` migration — handled in the same follow-up
  via dual-write: ``forecast_exception_detector`` keeps writing to
  the legacy ``forecast_exception`` table (existing CRUD endpoints +
  workflow surface stay live), AND emits a parallel Alert row
  (plane=DEMAND, type=VARIANCE_RELIABILITY) so the variance signal
  surfaces in the unified operator dashboard. The legacy table can
  retire once consumers are cut over in a future PR.
