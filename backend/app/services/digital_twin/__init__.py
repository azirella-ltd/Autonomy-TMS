"""TMS digital twin — carrier-flow plane.

Per Autonomy-Core/docs/architecture/TWIN_AND_ENVELOPES.md, the TMS twin
is split into:

  - shipment_generator: emits the exogenous TransferOrderEnvelope stream
    (line-item arrivals per origin/destination/product/bucket).
  - lane_flow_simulator: transition function over generator output —
    lane queues, dock dynamics, carrier capacity, equipment flow.
  - step_adapter: (observe, step, record) façade producing RL trajectories.

PR-1 is scaffolding — interfaces and dataclasses, no physics yet. PR-2
fills in the parametric shipment generator; PR-3 fills in the simulator.
