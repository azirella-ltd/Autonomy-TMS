"""TMS participant shim — re-exports canonical ScenarioUser from Core.

The canonical `ScenarioUser` (plus its enums and the back-relation on
`User`) lives in `azirella_data_model.simulation.scenario_user`. SCP and
TMS both consume it — moved 2026-05-13 because both planes registering
their own copy against the shared Base caused
`Multiple classes found for path "ScenarioUser"` 500s on the auth path
in the AD-13 modular-monolith topology. Same monkey-patch pattern
already used by `Scenario.scenario_users` in `app/models/scenario.py`.

This module adds the TMS-specific relationships to the canonical
ScenarioUser class. None of them target Core classes — they all
reference models that live only in TMS and are loaded before
configure_mappers() runs. The relationships are deliberately identical
to SCP's because the underlying tables (scenario_user_inventory,
orders, scenario_user_periods, function_assignments, agent_suggestions,
what_if_analyses) ARE substrate that both planes will eventually adopt
from Core; the per-plane shape is the migration bridge until each one
is promoted.

Backward-compatibility aliases (`Participant` → `ScenarioUser`, etc.)
are preserved for the small handful of legacy callsites still on the
pre-2026 names.
