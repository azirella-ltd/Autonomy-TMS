# Cross-plane data exchange — MCP only

**Hard rule.** Any direct read of another plane's database (today: SCP) must go through that plane's **MCP server**. Direct cross-plane DB reads, shared Docker networks for cross-plane DB hosts, and shared connection pools are deprecated — they couple deployment topology in ways the [SCP/TMS separation decision](../../../Autonomy-Core/docs/MIGRATION_REGISTER.md) explicitly rejects.

## Scope

This rule applies to every plane the TMS backend talks to:
- **SCP** — read SCP-resident data (supply plan, ATP, demand forecast, master data) via SCP's MCP server.
- **Future DP plane** — read demand envelope via DP's MCP server (once DP is physically extracted; today the DP plane is logical-only — see [MIGRATION_REGISTER §3.6](../../../Autonomy-Core/docs/MIGRATION_REGISTER.md)).
- **Future WMS / Sales / Revenue planes** — same rule when they exist.

Within-plane DB access (TMS reading TMS) is unaffected — that's just normal application code.

## Why

The cross-plane contract is a versioned MCP tool surface, not a SQL dialect. Going through MCP gives us:

1. **Topology-independent code.** TMS source doesn't know or care whether SCP runs on the same host, a different host, or in a different cloud region. MCP is HTTP-tier; works identically across all three.
2. **No cross-host DB credentials.** The `tms_reader@autonomy-scp-db` pattern only ever worked when both stacks were colocated on a single Docker host (`msi-stealth`). MCP needs only the SCP MCP endpoint URL + a service token — both are normal HTTP-API config, easy to rotate.
3. **Schema isolation.** SCP can refactor its tables without breaking TMS. The MCP tool surface is the contract; SCP-side serialisation handles schema migrations.
4. **Audit + governance.** Every cross-plane read goes through the MCP server's existing logging, auth, and rate limits. Direct DB reads bypass those.
5. **Failure isolation.** When SCP's MCP is down, TMS gets a clean error response and can degrade gracefully. When SCP's DB is up but its app is down, MCP fails clean; direct DB reads silently succeed and might serve TMS uncommitted or pre-migration data.
6. **Symmetric architecture.** SCP→TMS reads use TMS's MCP (see TMS-exposed tools below). It would be inconsistent to keep TMS→SCP on direct DB while SCP→TMS goes via MCP.

## Existing infrastructure

### TMS exposes for cross-plane consumers

`backend/app/mcp_server/server.py` runs as a sidecar (HTTP on 8002, proxied via Nginx at `/mcp`). Tool modules in `backend/app/mcp_server/tools/`:

| Module | Purpose | Notable tools |
|---|---|---|
| `ad11.py` | SCP × TMS intersection reads (AD-11 contract) | `get_carrier_capacity`, `get_dock_availability`, `get_active_exceptions` |
| `forecast.py` | TMS-side lane / shipment forecasts | `get_forecast` |
| `decision_stream.py` | TMS decision stream events | `get_decision_stream` |
| `network.py` | Network-level state | `get_network_status` |
| `kpi.py` | KPI metrics | `get_kpi_metrics` |
| `atp.py` | ATP / capacity promise context | (multiple) |
| `governance.py` | Governance pipeline state | `get_governance_status` |
| `override.py` | User-override audit | (multiple) |
| `reasoning.py` | Decision reasoning chains | (multiple) |

If SCP needs additional TMS-resident data, **add a tool here** rather than expecting SCP to read `autonomy-tms-db` directly.

### SCP exposes for TMS consumption

Mirror surface lives in `Autonomy-SCP/backend/app/mcp_server/tools/`:

| Module | Purpose | Notable tools |
|---|---|---|
| `intersection_reads.py` | SCP-side reads TMS calls per AD-11 | `get_atp_constraints`, `get_demand_forecast`, `get_supply_plan` |
| Plus: `forecast.py`, `network.py`, `kpi.py`, `decision_stream.py`, `governance.py`, `override.py`, `reasoning.py`, `atp.py` |

When TMS needs SCP-resident data **not** already covered, the right move is to **request a new SCP MCP tool** — not to add a direct DB read.

## Existing direct-DB code (demo cleanup, NOT a rule violation to remediate as architecture)

There is one pre-existing TMS code path that talks directly to SCP's Postgres via the `tms_reader` role. **It is synthetic demo-bootstrap tooling, not production cross-plane integration**, and it is **not** the canonical example of "TMS uses MCP to call SCP":

- [`backend/app/services/tms/scp_etl.py`](../../backend/app/services/tms/scp_etl.py) — `FoodDistExtractor` (10 queries against SCP tables, used to seed the Food Dist demo when both stacks run on one host).
- [`backend/scripts/extract_scp_food_dist.py`](../../backend/scripts/extract_scp_food_dist.py) — CLI driver for the above.
- [`backend/app/core/config.py:222`](../../backend/app/core/config.py#L222) — `SCP_DB_URL: Optional[str]` setting supporting the demo extractor.

**Disposition:** Tier 4 / demo cleanup, tracked in [MIGRATION_REGISTER §3.7](../../../Autonomy-Core/docs/MIGRATION_REGISTER.md). When the demo retires or the code gets touched, delete or replace with a small JSON-snapshot exporter — no Core schema, no production-grade MCP contract required. **Do not treat this as the model for production cross-plane reads.** Real cross-plane reads (SCP supply plan, demand forecast, ATP constraints, etc.) go through MCP from day one — those are the canonical examples of this rule.

The rule in full force: NEW code that needs cross-plane data uses MCP. The existing demo extractor is grandfathered cleanup, not a forward-looking architecture concern.

## Known gaps in current MCP coverage

A 2026-04-29 audit of TMS's MCP surface against the queries SCP would realistically make found three gaps. **If you find yourself wanting one of these, ADD THE TOOL — do not work around it with a direct DB read or by extending `scp_etl.py`.** All three are tracked in [Autonomy-Core MIGRATION_REGISTER §3.8](../../../Autonomy-Core/docs/MIGRATION_REGISTER.md).

### Gap 1 — `get_realized_shipments` (TMS-side, CRITICAL)

**What's missing:** An MCP tool exposing realised shipment outcomes (delivered quantity, on-time variance, transit time, exceptions) so SCP can drive forecast retraining, FVA metrics, demand-sensing TRM updates, and inventory-buffer learning without a direct DB read.

**Underlying canonical state already in Core:** `LanePerformanceActuals` and `ServiceCommitmentOutcomes` (`azirella_data_model.intersections.supply_transport.feedback`). TMS already writes both of these via `ShipmentTrackingTRM.record_lane_performance_for_recently_delivered()` and the dispatch outcome path. **The tables and the writers exist. The gap is the MCP transport.**

**Add the tool as:**
```python
get_realized_shipments(
    tenant_id, config_id,
    site_id?, lane_id?, product_id?,
    delivered_after, delivered_before,
    limit: int = 1000,
) -> {"count": int, "shipments": [ <TMS-local response model>, ...], "as_of_utc": datetime}
```

**Response shape is TMS-side, producer-owned.** It is *not* a Core type. Define the typed response model in TMS's `app/mcp_server/tools/` (or a sibling `schemas/` module) — that's where MCP tool wire formats belong. SCP either deserialises with its own Pydantic projection of the fields it cares about, consumes as `dict[str, Any]`, or imports the response model from TMS via standard MCP tool versioning. **Don't put the wire format in Core** — API contracts are owned by the producer; canonical state (the ORM tables) is what's correctly in Core.

### Gap 2 — SCP MCP server isn't running independently (HIGH)

**What's missing:** SCP has tool handlers in code, but no evidence of an independently-deployed MCP server in production. SCP's MCP client is wired only for ERP endpoints, not TMS.

**What this means for TMS work:** if TMS code wants to call SCP via MCP today, it can't yet. Tracked in §3.8.2 (Core register). Don't work around it with a direct DB read against SCP — wait for the productionisation, or escalate.

### Gap 3 — Intersection-contract MCP tools (HIGH)

**What's missing:** SCP can ASK TMS "can you move this?" via `get_carrier_capacity` etc. SCP cannot SAY "I'm committing this and I need TMS to confirm." The joint-commit pattern (`ServiceWindowPromise`, `DeploymentRequirement`) has no MCP read or write tools on either side.

**What this means for TMS work:** any new code that needs cross-plane *commit* (not just *read*) lands in §3.8.3 territory. Add the right tool symmetric on both sides; don't fake it with a one-direction call.

## Plane-absence fallback semantics — every cross-plane MCP call must declare one

**Customers do not always deploy both planes.** A pure transport 3PL runs TMS with no SCP. A planning-only customer runs SCP and routes transport through external tooling. An integrated customer runs both. Every cross-plane MCP call in TMS must therefore work in all three deployments — degraded gracefully when the peer plane is absent, never crashing or silently corrupting state.

**The contract:**

When TMS code calls a peer-plane MCP tool, the caller MUST handle three failure modes and document the fallback:

1. **Peer plane not registered** — the plane registry returns no entry for the peer. Probable cause: customer hasn't deployed it. **Fallback:** drop into solo-mode behavior (defined per call site). Log at INFO level (operational, not error).
2. **Peer plane unreachable** — registry has an entry but the endpoint times out / refuses connection. Probable cause: peer is deployed but down. **Fallback:** same solo-mode behavior. Log at WARN level (operational issue worth noticing).
3. **Peer plane returns an error** — the call connects but the tool returns an error response, schema mismatch, or empty result. Probable cause: peer is deployed but the data SCP wants doesn't exist for this tenant/config. **Fallback:** call-site-specific (sometimes solo-mode, sometimes raise). Log at WARN level with the peer's error body.

**Rules of thumb for picking the fallback:**

- **Read calls** (e.g. SCP→TMS `get_carrier_capacity` to check capacity before ATP-promise): solo-mode = the current pre-MCP behavior. SCP today doesn't check TMS capacity before promising, so solo-mode = optimistic ATP. The fallback should match what SCP would do if TMS's MCP didn't exist at all.
- **Feedback calls** (e.g. SCP←TMS `get_realized_shipments` for forecast retraining): solo-mode = forecast retrains from training corpus only, no live-shipment learning loop. Mark forecast quality metrics as "no realised-outcome feedback available" so the user knows.
- **Write calls** (e.g. intersection-contract `request_deployment_requirement`): solo-mode = the writer plane logs the requirement locally only and proceeds with its own plan. Do NOT pretend the commit was confirmed.

**Anti-patterns:**

- Silent degradation. If a cross-plane call fails, the calling code must log it. The customer's ops team has to know cross-plane integration is degraded — otherwise they won't notice that SCP forecasts are running blind for two weeks.
- "Pretend the call succeeded" defaults. Returning an empty list when the peer is absent looks identical to "peer returned no rows." Use sentinel values or explicit absence markers.
- Hard-coded peer URLs as fallback. The plane registry is the resolution mechanism. If the registry says peer is absent, that's the answer; don't second-guess via a fallback URL.
- "We'll add the fallback later." Each MCP call ships **with** its fallback. No fallback = the call is not production-ready.

**For tooling: the rule applies symmetrically to TMS-as-callee.** When SCP calls a TMS MCP tool and TMS isn't deployed, SCP's calling code is what falls back — but TMS's own tool design should still be tolerant of unusual inputs (empty tenants, no rows, partial config) and return clean typed-empty responses rather than 500 errors. Tools in `app/mcp_server/tools/*` should be treated as part of TMS's external API surface.

## Smaller hygiene flags

Audit also surfaced (track in §3.8 hygiene rollup):

- `get_governance_status` takes only `tenant_id`, no `config_id` — tighten when next touched.
- `chat_with_decisions` returns freeform text — not safe for cross-plane structured callers; consider gating it as session-internal.
- Conformal bands (`p10`, `p50`, `p90`) on `get_carrier_capacity` collapse to point estimates until `conformal.active_predictors` is populated. Shape is correct; data is degenerate.
- `get_carrier_capacity` exposes only a 14d aggregate carrier acceptance rate — per-carrier detail will be needed for SCP's carrier-tier ATP eventually. Defer until concrete consumer demand surfaces.

## How to apply (every TMS PR)

- **New code that needs SCP-resident data** → use SCP's MCP. If the right tool doesn't exist, request it from the SCP team (or write it on the SCP side first); don't extend `scp_etl.py`.
- **New code in any plane that needs TMS-resident data** → add a tool to TMS's `app/mcp_server/tools/` rather than allowing a direct read into `autonomy-tms-db`.
- **Editing `scp_etl.py` or `extract_scp_food_dist.py`** → migrate that piece to MCP rather than extending it. The whole file is on the migration target list.
- **Adding new fields to `SCP_DB_URL`-using settings** → do not. New cross-plane config goes through the MCP client, not the legacy SCP DB credential.
- **Co-locating TMS with SCP for dev** → fine, opt in with `SCP_COLOCATED=1` (Makefile gate). Don't make it the default.

## What this rule does NOT cover

- **MCP writebacks** are a separate design question. Today the rule is about reads. Cross-plane writes need explicit per-tool design (audit, idempotency, rollback) — don't add them implicitly.
- **Within-plane DB access** is unaffected. TMS reading its own DB is normal application code.
- **Real-time streaming** (e.g. SCP supply-plan updates pushed to TMS) is out of scope of this rule. Current ETL is snapshot semantics; if streaming is needed later, that's a separate cross-plane contract.
